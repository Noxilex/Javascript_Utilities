# Javascript_Utilities

## Recap

A github repository containing a collection of useful functions I've discovered & used many times.

## Introduction
As a fervent user of Javascript, I keep making new project which all share similar needs:
- I always need a function to check if an array contains a specific value
- I always need a Point class that stores x & y value
- I always need a random color generator for debugging or having fun
... 

*So I kept doing the same thing over and over*... **But that's enough !** 

I've now created a dedicated repository to store all of those useful functions & improve them over time.

I hope you can learn a few things along the way & maybe you can teach me some neat tricks you've discovered.
